# Getting started

## 
## The environment
Everything on this site is based of 3 things
1. A MySQL database to hold all content
2. An API to route all data
3. Templates to create pages out of a mix of PHP and HTML

From this environment you will be able to have almost full control over the site
without having to enter any external text editor or command-line interface 
(other than to update the routes, which will be covered later in the documentation)

## The dashboard
The dashboard is your hub for everything. Here you can add pages, create blog posts,
add files, and manage users. You can also manage your page templates straight from
the dashboard.
